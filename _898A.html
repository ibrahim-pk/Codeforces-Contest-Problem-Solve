      <!-- problem description -->
      <div>
       <p>  There are three cards with letters a,b,cplaced in a row in some order. You can do the following operation at most
        once: <br>
        * Pick two cards, and swap them.<br>
        Is it possible that the row becomes abc
        after the operation? Output "YES" if it is possible, and "NO" otherwise.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- input section -->

        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p> 
            The first line contains a single integer t(1≤t≤6) — the number of test cases.
            The only line of each test case contains a single string consisting of each of
            the three characters a,b,and c exactly once, representing the cards</p>
      </div>
      <!-- output section -->
      <div>
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p> 
            For each test case, output "YES" if you can make the row abc with at most one
            operation, or "NO" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for
            example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a
            positive answer).
